# JHU - JScholarship
This is a fork of DSpace that has been customized for John Hopkins University's institutional repository, JScholarship.

## Version
This current build of JScholarship is based on the DSpace version tagged [DSpace-5.5](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/tree/dspace-5.5)

## Theme
JScholarship makes use of the Mirage2 responsive theme. Thus far, our variations from this theme fall within the customization options described in the [Mirage 2 documentation](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC5x/Mirage+2+Configuration+and+Customization), and do not warrant a complete theme of our own.

## Branding
JScholarship's custom styles use colors selected from the university's official [color palette](http://brand.jhu.edu/color/) including:

Color       | Pantone  | Web
---         | ---      | ---
logo_blue   | PMS 288C | #002D72
medium_blue | PMS 300C | #005EB8
blue_grey   | PMS 651C | #A7BCD6
